# 🗳️ Voting System using Blockchain

A decentralized web application that enables users to securely cast their votes online using blockchain technology.  
This project ensures **tamper-proof**, **transparent**, and **verifiable** elections by storing voting records on the blockchain.  
The backend is built using the Python-based web framework **Django**.

---

## 📘 Introduction

Online voting platforms are often vulnerable to manipulation and security risks.  
This project solves that by using **blockchain** to store votes immutably, providing end-to-end security and transparency.  
Users verify their identity using **email OTP**, receive a **private key**, and securely cast their vote — all through a simple web interface.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 Secure voter registration and login  
- 📩 Email OTP verification for authentication  
- 🔑 Private key generation for secure voting  
- 📊 Real-time vote counting and results display  
- 🪙 Immutable vote storage on blockchain  
- 🧑‍💻 Admin panel for managing proposals and voters

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voting-system-blockchain.git
cd voting-system-blockchain
````

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Configure Email Settings

Edit `Election/settings.py`:

```python
EMAIL_ADDRESS = "your_email@gmail.com"
EMAIL_PASSWORD = "your_app_password"
```

📌 **Tip:** Use [Google App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) for better security.

---

### 4️⃣ (Optional) Disable Email Sending During Development

To avoid email limits during development, modify `views.py`:

```python
# In send_otp()
[success, result] = send_email_otp(email_input)
# [success, result] = [True, '0']  # Uncomment this for development

# In get_parties()
send_email_private_key(request.session['email-id'], private_key)
# print(private_key)
```

---

### 5️⃣ Run the Project

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### 6️⃣ Access the App

Visit the URL shown in the terminal (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`).

---

## 🔁 How It Works

1. **User Registration:** User signs up and receives an OTP via email.
2. **Verification:** After OTP verification, a private key is generated.
3. **Voting:** User casts a vote on available proposals.
4. **Blockchain Storage:** Votes are hashed and stored immutably on the blockchain.
5. **Results:** Votes are counted and displayed in real-time.

✅ Save this as `README.md` in your project directory — GitHub will automatically render it beautifully.  
Would you like me to create a **project diagram (architecture flow)** for this too? (It helps a lot if you plan to showcase this in interviews or on GitHub.)
