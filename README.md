# 🗳️ Voting System using Blockchain

This is a simple decentralized voting application built using **Python (Django)** and **Blockchain technology**.  
It allows users to securely **register, verify their identity, and cast their vote online**, while ensuring that all votes are **tamper-proof and immutable** by storing them on the blockchain.

## 📌 What It Has

- User registration and login system  
- Email OTP verification for secure authentication  
- Automatic private key generation for each voter  
- Secure vote casting (each user can vote only once)  
- Results displayed in real-time  
- All votes stored immutably using blockchain

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Register:** A user creates an account with their email.  
2. **Verify:** An OTP is sent to their email for verification.  
3. **Private Key:** Once verified, a private key is generated and sent to the user.  
4. **Vote:** The user logs in, selects a candidate, and casts their vote.  
5. **Blockchain Storage:** The vote is stored on the blockchain so it cannot be changed or tampered with.  
6. **Results:** The votes are counted and results are displayed publicly and transparently.
